## Bugs
* If a student adds private homework for a class the teacher will see it on their approval page.
* http://ctrlv.in/665716 The "approved and visible" should show the "will not appear" in the same text.
* Course name in HW dirary should link to course
* http://ctrlv.in/665721 This should be a diferent colour to show that it's pending. Add a key of colours at the bottom?

## To Do
* Students can enter how long it actually took them
    * Timer to use for that
* Ability to put links to upload/submission/some resource on Moodle in the description
