# Moodle Homework Diary

Allows teachers (and optionally students) to add homework for courses.

**Note:** This was previously called *block_homework* but renamed to *block_homework_diary* to not clash with a different plugin that was added to the Moodle plugin directory since the creation of this plugin.

## Installation
* Install (clone, or copy) the plugin to /blocks/homework_diary
* Visit http://www.your-moodle-url.com/blocks/homework_diary to view the diary (this is currently the only way to use it. Adding it as a block on a course currently isn't suppoted.
